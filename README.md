# 2. Must-Eat List

## Must-Eat
- Ramen (ラーメン): Any ramen restaurant is fine, but Ichiran (一蘭) is quite popular and very tasty. 
- Sushi (寿司) in authentic sushi restaurant: You're in Japan, you must eat the real sushi. 
- Or Sushi in conveyor belt sushi restaurant (especially hi-tech one is fun): Not as tasty as authentic one, but still very good. And some conveyor belt sushi restaurants are very creative and hi-tech.
- Izakaya (居酒屋) food: Izakaya is a Japanese tapas-style restaurant/bar. Millions of Izakayas in any cities in Japan. 
- Onigiri (おにぎり): Japanese rice ball in convenience stores. We eat Onigiri for lunch instead of sandwich. 
- Japanese snacks and sweets from convenience stores: Japanese snacks are quite different from ones in Europe, and very tasty (for me). 
- Japanese curry (カレー): Japanese curry is completely different from Indian/Thai curry. And most of "Japanese curry" in Japanese restaurants outside of Japan (in my experience) are quite different from what we eat in Japan. Many restaurants have Curry in their menu in Japan, and there are some chain restaurants specialised in Curry, such as Coco Ichiban (CoCo壱番屋), which is in everywhere in Tokyo. 
- Soba (そば): Japanese traditional noodle. Although Ramen is the most popular Japanese noodle food, Soba is more traditional food for Japanese culture and as popular as Ramen in Japan.
- Sake (日本酒): There are millions of Sake in Japan. Most of restauratnts / bars / Izakaya have multiple Sake, so ask them for their recommendations. 
- Wagyu (和牛): There are many places you can try Wagyu beef (e.g. Steak house, Teppanyaki (鉄板焼き) restaurant) but my recommendation is Yakiniku (焼肉) restaurant. Yakiniku is originally from Korea, but it's now a part of Japanese culture. You can grill Wagyu beef by yourself. 

## Interesting food to try
Not Must-Eat, but interesting to try.
- Syochu (焼酎): Japanese spirit, taste like Vodka. Quite popular in Japan. 
- Basashi (馬刺し): Horse meat, eaten raw. 
- Natto (納豆): Japanese traditional food (fermented soybeans), smelling very bad. If you stay in Ryokan/Hotel with breakfast included, they might provide Natto. Usually eat with rice. 
- Fugu (ふぐ): Puffer fish, eaten in raw (sashimi). Fugu is one of the groumet food in Japan. Quite expensive but really tasty. (Fugu has very strong poison, so only licensed chef can cook it.)
- Gyu-don (牛丼): Gyu-don (Beef rice bowl) is a "traditional fast food" consisting of a bowl of rice topped with beef and onion simmered in a mildly sweet sauce. There are some chain restaurants for Gyu-don, such as Yoshino-ya (吉野家), Matsu-ya (松屋) and Suki-ya (すき家) - all of them available in any cities in Japan.
